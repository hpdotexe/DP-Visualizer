# DP-Visualizer

Project is made and testing using JDK 17 - Coretto and hosted using Tomcat 10.1.91 server. 

To access Active Directory properties for authentication (declared inside the Constants class), a ".env" file must be created with all the required tokens inside the classpath (resources folder).

The DPVisualizer.json file can be imported using retool to access the UI after the backend is deployed.
